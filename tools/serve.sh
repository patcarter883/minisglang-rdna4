# serve.sh — turn a handful of CHOICES into a minisgl launch line.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   docker-compose.yml carried eight near-identical serve services (serve, qwen, glm, qwen35b-mtp,
#   qwen35b-dflash, laguna, laguna-dflash, laguna-radix). They ran the SAME command and differed only
#   in a model id, a spec algorithm, a draft path and an attention backend — so every new model or
#   spec mode meant another copy-pasted 40-line block, and 60 MINISGL_* variables between them. Adding
#   a knob meant editing eight places, and the combinations that were not pre-baked (laguna+mtp,
#   glm+dflash, anything with DP or EP) simply did not exist.
#
#   The variation is a small TABLE, not eight services. This file is that table.
#
# THE CHOICES (all optional; every one has a default)
#   MODEL   alias below, or any HF id / local path      (default qwen35b-awq)
#   SPEC    none|mtp|dflash|eagle3|ngram|tidar          (default: the model's own default)
#   DRAFT   draft checkpoint for dflash/eagle3          (default: per model; required if none)
#   SPEC_K  draft length                                (default: per model+algorithm, tuned)
#   TP      tensor-parallel size, 1 or 2                (default 2)
#   DP      data-parallel size, 1 or 2                  (default 1)
#   EP      1 to enable expert parallelism              (default 0)
#   CTX     context length in tokens                    (default: the checkpoint's own)
#   CONC    concurrent requests                         (default 4)
#
# LESS-USED, still here rather than in eight copies:
#   ATTN (auto|hip|triton), MEM_RATIO, GRAPH_BS, PAGE_SIZE, CACHE_TYPE, PORT, EXTRA_ARGS.
#   EXTRA_ARGS is appended verbatim and wins — the escape hatch for anything not modelled here.
#
# Print the composed line without running it:  DRY_RUN=1 tools/serve.sh
