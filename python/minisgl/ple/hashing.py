"""Qwen4-Exp n-gram hashing — the function that turns recent token ids into table row ids.

STATUS: **VERIFIED**, not inferred. Every line below is a transcription of
`transformers/models/qwen4_exp/modeling_qwen4_exp.py` @ `huggingface/transformers` `main`
(`Qwen4ExpTextNGramEmbedding.forward`, `_shift_right_ignore_eos`, `_build_layer_multipliers`,
`_splitmix64`, `_find_nth_prime_after`) — the reference implementation of the architecture, fetched
2026-09-03. Two independent checks tie the transcription to the SHIPPING checkpoint rather than to
the source alone (both are asserted in `tests/qwen4exp_ple_hash_test.py`):

  * `layer_multipliers` derived here from `(vocab_size=248320, ngram_size=3, ple_layer_index=0,
    seed=1234)` equals `RadixArk/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4`'s
    `...ple.ple_embedding.layer_multipliers` EXACTLY: `[23703573157769, 20109073645365,
    8052911324071]`.
  * the 16 head vocab sizes derived here (the first 16 primes > 20,000,000 - 1) equal the
    checkpoint's `ngram_heads_vocab_sizes`, and their prefix sum equals `ngram_heads_offsets`.

WHY THIS FILE IS SO CAREFUL
---------------------------
Nothing here can fail loudly. A wrong multiplier, a wrong shift, a wrong head->n-gram assignment or
a wrong EOS fill still produces a valid row id in the right head's band, so the model reads a real
embedding — just the wrong one, for every token, forever. The only symptom is quality. Hence: one
named function per piece of the arithmetic, the derivation kept next to the checkpoint value it must
reproduce, and a test that asserts the equality instead of trusting it.

THE ARITHMETIC
--------------
`ngram_size = 3`, `heads_per_ngram = 8` -> `ngram_heads = (3 - 1) * 8 = 16` hash heads, which is
exactly the 16 bands `row_table.NgramHeads` addresses (embedding width 2560 = 16 x 160).

For a token at position `p` with history `t`:

    s_k[p] = t[p - k]  , or EOS when p - k falls before the current EOS-delimited segment  (k=0,1,2)
    mixed_n[p] = XOR_{k<n} ( s_k[p] * layer_multipliers[k] )      for n in {2, 3}
    head h in [0, 8)   uses mixed_2 ;  head h in [8, 16) uses mixed_3
    row[p, h] = offsets[h] + mixed_{n(h)}[p] mod vocab_sizes[h]

`layer_multipliers[k]` is odd and bounded by `(2**63 - 1) // vocab_size`, so `s_k * m_k` never
overflows int64 and `mixed_n` is always non-negative — `np.mod`/`torch.remainder` therefore agree,
and neither can produce a negative row id.

Everything here is numpy and torch-free: the gather it feeds is an NVMe/page-cache read on the host
(`weights/row_table.py`), so the hash belongs on the host too, next to it.
